# False-banknotes-identification
A simple course ending project (FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE: K-MEANS CLUSTERING IN PYTHON - Coursera). 

The goal was only to test K-means clustering application to a real life problem - it wasn't necessary for the model to be well fitted to the task and little optimization was performed. Results and insights obtained were described in .pdf file.
